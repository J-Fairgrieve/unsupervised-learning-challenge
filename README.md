# Unsupervised Learning Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (April 2022)

The aim of this project was to transform a raw data file & use unsupervised learning methods to determine whether cryptocurrencies can be clustered together with other similar cryptocurrencies. Key skills used include:

 - Data cleansing
 - PCA & t-SNE models
 - k-Means modelling

### Conclusion

The further analysis suggests that there cryptocurrency can potentially be clustered. The four clusters cover:

 - **Group 1 (green):** x = low, y = high
 - **Group 2 (yellow):** x = varied, x = low
 - **Group 3 (purple):** x = low, y = higher than group 1 
 - **Group 4 (Blue):** x = varied, y = moderate/high
 
Further analysis chould be undertaken by modifying the learning rate in the t-SNE section of the dimensionality reduction or by looking at a different number of clusters (perhaps three clusters instead).
